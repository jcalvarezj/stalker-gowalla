    "Use the dataset here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume a \"stalker\" is someone who, in this dataset, visits some of the same locations as another person, after the other person goes to that location.\n",
    "* A \"stalker score\" for a pair of people, A & B, is the number of locations for which A has visited a location followed by B visiting that same location in the\n",
    "future.\n",
    "* Any given location should be counted once in the score, so a stalker score can never be higher than the number of unique locations that A and B have\n",
    "in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the datasets from the web page above to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which friend pair has the highest \"stalker score\"?\n",
    "2. Which non-friend pair has the highest \"stalker score\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use any tools you want to solve this puzzle, except asking for help from other people. Please feel free to email at any time for any clarifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please give the winning user id pairs and “stalker score” for each question, and please explain your solution methods, including any source code if you wrote any.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ps. We give points for \"pure\" solutions, so no additional libraries. The more complex the additional libraries are the more points we deduct**"
